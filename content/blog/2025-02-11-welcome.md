Welcome to Johnnie's Place. We're building something meaningful here - a sustainable model for community care and housing for adults on the Autism Spectrum.

## Our Beginning

John's life was a struggle every day, and his untimely passing showed us something critical: the real issue wasn't just medical care. It was isolation. It was the lack of community.

That realization changed everything.

## Moving Forward

We're taking this step by step, planting seeds, watering them, nurturing them. It will take time, but that's okay. The important thing is creating a model that works - one that serves adults like John and provides a blueprint that others can follow.

## Get Involved

Whether you're interested in volunteering, making a donation, or simply learning more about our mission, we'd love to hear from you. Together, we can ensure that no one faces their challenges alone.

Thank you for being part of this journey.
