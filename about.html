          <h2>From Pain Comes Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            John's life was a struggle every day. The resulting pain and suffering shaped everyone in his family and many who served him during his life. Unfortunately, he died tragically from undetected pneumonia with Covid, as he became more vulnerable and frail due to those hardships, difficult treatments, and the loss of community.
          </p>
          <p>
            After John passed, his father Michael faced an important choice: he could grieve him terribly forever, which he will, or he could also redirect that pain and loss into something meaningful, purposeful and positive.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="emphasis-quote">
            "Create and execute on an act of charity that John so deserved and was deprived of, but is still relevant despite his untimely passing because there are so many other souls like him, along with their loved ones and caretakers, who still need solutions for housing and services due to their unfortunate lot in life."

        <h2>Building a Replicable Model</h2>
        <p>
          Michael knows how to do this and is determined to accomplish it step by step to create a model that others can replicate. It will take time and it will be built step by step over years, but that's okay.
        </p>

          "We just have to plant the seeds, water them, nurture them. The truth is none of our life's work is ever 'done.' We just leave it for others to pick up and continue. The important thing is that it is designed, formed and then serves a small group of other 'Johns' and that it provides a blueprint for others."

        <p>
          Michael Dinda will own the property and will enter into market leases and collect rent plus utility costs from the residential tenants' families. Dinda will enter into a long-term leasehold interest with Johnnie's Place as charitable donations are secured by the non-profit to improve the physical residence to meet the needs of the mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dinda intends to make additional periodic charitable donations to improve the physical residence and will also donate his time to manage the property and oversee the management and fiduciary responsibilities of the not-for-profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Existing equity in the home and equity gained through debt reduction will be gifted to the non-profit through the leasehold mortgage instrument, annual gifting, or Dinda's will and estate planning to be determined.
